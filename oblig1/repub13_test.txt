Plato's Republic

July, 1994  [Etext #150]



****The Project Gutenberg Etext of The Republic, by Plato*****
*****This file should be named repub13.txt or repub13.zip*****

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, repub14.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, repub13a.txt

We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.
